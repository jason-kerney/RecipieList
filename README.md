## Instapot

- [Parmesan Risotto](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/instant-pot-parmesan-risotto/)
  - Needs more Parmesan and Onion
- [Lamb Shank](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-lamb-shank/)
- [Pot Roast](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/pot_roast/)
  - For that one, we skip the carrots and make them on the side. Other adjustments - sear meat Â in instant pot, 4 minutes each side. Use 1/2 cup wine, 1/2 cup chicken or beef broth. Cook on high pressure 90 minutes
  - Pull the meat out when done, discard the bay leaf and put broth and onions in a blender and puree. Return to instant pot and add back in pulled apart roast
